Sup is a disgustingly cutesy name for a pretty bare-bones monitoring app. And by
"Monitoring" I mean when you load the app's page, it checks all the sites in its
registry to see if they are up or not. There's no notification or automatic 
polling. It's pretty pointless unless you stick it in a web browser that 
automatically reloads and is in plain sight. Sort of like our CI box.

Requirements:
* Sinatra
